/* Set to true to enable precise timing mode (68000 and 68010 only).
 *
 * If disabled, Moira calls function 'sync' at the end of each instruction
 * with the number of elapsed cycles as argument. In precise timing mode,
 * 'sync' is called prior to each memory access. This enables the client to
 * emulate the surrounding hardware up the point where the memory access
 * actually happens.
 *
 * Precise timing mode is only available in 68000 or 68010 emulation. For
 * all other supported models, this setting has no effect.
 *
 * Enable to improve accuracy, disable to gain speed.

 * client. If this option is set to true, all API functions are declared
 * virtual which corresponds to the standard OOP pradigm. Because virtual
 * functions impose a performance penalty, Moira allows to link the client API
 * statically by setting this option to false.
